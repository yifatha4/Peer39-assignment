Overview
This project implements a system for categorizing web pages based on predefined keyword categories using Java. The system utilizes the Aho-Corasick algorithm for efficient multi-pattern keyword matching, leveraging the org.ahocorasick library and Jsoup for HTML parsing and text extraction.

Features
Keyword-Based Categorization: Classify web pages into categories based on predefined keywords.
Efficient Multi-Pattern Matching: Use the Aho-Corasick algorithm to efficiently search for multiple keywords within the text content of web pages.
HTML Parsing and Cleaning: Fetch and clean web page content using Jsoup to remove unnecessary HTML elements and URLs.

Trie Data Structure
The system uses the Trie data structure from the org.ahocorasick library to store and search for keywords efficiently.

categoryTries: A map that associates each category name with a corresponding Trie built from its keywords.
Building the Trie
Time Complexity: Building a Trie for a single category with k keywords, each of average length l O(k*l)*M ( m- numbers of categories)
